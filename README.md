## General

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5. I've chosen to create a single angular workspace for the whole course and create different angular projects within, for the different subjects and course projects.

This way I could be make it all more efficient in terms of disk space usage, as all projects can share the same node modules (which in this case is the ) and I could also learn how to serve and menage the creating of new components, directives, services, modules, among other things into a specific project which share the same workspace with other projects.
